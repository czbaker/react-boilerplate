# React-Boilerplate

This is a small boilerplate to be used for starting new front-end projects that use React, created with CRA (Create React App)

It has the following set up:

* React
* TypeScript
* MobX (with React bindings) (state management)
* React Router (routing/etc.)
* Semantic UI React (w/ LESS support for theming/overloading)

HMR is built in!

More will be added over time, keep this updated!
